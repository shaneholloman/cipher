# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to ByteRover CLI will be documented in this file.

## [3.10.3]

### Fixed
- **No more silent daemon-version mismatches.** After upgrading `brv`, the background daemon could keep running on the older version and you'd have no way to tell, leading to confusing "why doesn't this new feature work?" moments. The REPL header now shows `[outdated, daemon vX.Y.Z]` next to the version when this happens, and replies from the MCP tools (`brv-query`, `brv-curate`) include a short note when the daemon and CLI are mismatched. Run `brv restart` to align, or restart your IDE for the MCP side.

## [3.10.2]

### Changed
- **`brv curate` is faster and cheaper.** Curate now batches its smaller LLM calls together and reuses the unchanging parts of the prompt across calls. Anthropic users save 21-30% on token cost, OpenAI users around 8%, and big-folder curates finish noticeably sooner.
- **Clearer sign-in error for ByteRover.** When you try to use ByteRover without being signed in, the error now lists every option: `brv login` for interactive shells, plus a signup URL, an API-key URL, and `brv login --api-key` for headless or CI environments.

### Fixed
- **ByteRover provider activates on connect.** Picking ByteRover used to leave it "connected but inactive", so `brv curate` would still say "no provider connected". Activation now happens right away.
- **No more spurious "signed out" on slow networks.** The startup auth check timed out after 500 ms, well below a real round-trip on home Wi-Fi, mobile, or VPN. Timeout is now 4 seconds with a single retry, so transient blips no longer look like a logout.

## [3.10.1]

### Added
- **`brv review --disable` / `--enable` per project.** Opt a project out of the human-in-the-loop review prompts and backups, or turn them back on. Run `brv review` with no flags to see the current state. Existing `brv review pending / approve / reject` are unchanged.

### Changed
- **`brv curate` returns to your prompt right away.** The final summary-rebuild step now runs in the background instead of making you wait. Nothing is skipped, just moved off your wait time (about 18 seconds saved on a typical run).

### Fixed
- **Clearer `brv vc status` and `brv vc pull` errors.** Status now catches a few staged-then-edited file states it used to hide. When a pull, checkout, or merge would overwrite local changes, the error now lists the affected files instead of just saying "local changes would be overwritten."
- **OpenAI-compatible providers fail loudly when the URL is wrong.** First-time setup for Ollama, LM Studio, and similar providers now checks the base URL up front and shows the error inline. Bad URLs no longer pre-select a placeholder `llama3` model or hang the REPL on disconnect / reconnect.

## [3.10.0]

### Added
- **Connect OpenClaude as an agent.** Run `brv connectors install "OpenClaude"` or pick it in `/connectors`.

### Changed
- **Prettier `brv login` confirmation page.** The browser tab after sign-in now matches the brv dark theme, with a styled error page if sign-in fails.
- **Faster, more reliable first-run startup.** The first `brv` command after install or restart connects more consistently, and no longer hangs when the sign-in provider is slow.

### Fixed
- **`brv restart` works inside nested shell wrappers.** Used to leave the daemon stuck when `brv` was launched through several wrapper scripts (a shell alias, an npm script, or a CI runner). Fixed on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- **`brv curate` counts as one operation, not many.** Curating many folders at once was being billed once per folder, which could push fresh free-tier accounts past their limit in a single run. Grouped correctly now.
- **Security update.** Patched `postcss` and several other dependencies to address a high-severity advisory.

## [3.9.0]

### Added
- **`brv vc diff` shows what changed in your context tree.** See staged and unstaged changes against HEAD, or compare branches and commits. Also available as `/vc-diff` in the REPL and with `--format json`.
- **`brv vc remote remove` deletes a git remote.** Available from the CLI and from a new Delete button (with confirmation) in the web UI Remotes panel.
- **Configuration page in `brv webui`.** Manage your context-tree git identity (user.name, user.email) and the `origin` remote from the browser. One click seeds your identity from your signed-in ByteRover account; a status dot is amber when identity is unset and green once it is. Provider and remote error toasts deep-link back to the relevant section.

### Changed
- **First-run tour teaches by clicking through.** Instead of auto-opening the composer, the tour highlights the Tasks tab and "New task" button with a glowing arrow and dims the rest of the page. Failed tasks during the tour now offer a "Try again" action that prefills the composer.
- **ByteRover pinned at the top of the provider picker.** In `brv webui`, ByteRover sits first with a "Native" badge and opens the sign-in popup directly, with no extra confirmation step.

### Fixed
- **Google default model updated to `gemini-3-flash-preview`** (was `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`).
- **`brv dream` no longer pollutes `brv vc` diffs.** Synthesis used to reorder context-file frontmatter fields (`title`, `summary`, `tags`, `keywords`, `related`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`); field order is now preserved.

## [3.8.3]

### Changed
- **`brv login` opens your browser by default** — Just run `brv login` and sign in in your browser. On CI or a remote shell, use `--api-key <key>` instead (get one at https://app.byterover.dev/settings/keys). SSH and non-interactive shells are detected automatically and skip the browser step.
- **Provider picker shows what each provider is** — `brv providers list` and the web provider picker now show a short description under each name, so you can pick by what a provider does instead of guessing from the brand.

### Fixed
- **No more "Logged in as undefined"** — `brv login` now says "Logged in successfully" when the server doesn't return your email.
- **`brv webui` works when installed under a hidden folder** — Reloading a page like `/contexts` no longer 404s when `brv` lives under a dotfile path such as `~/.nvm/...` or `~/.asdf/...`.

## [3.8.2]

### Fixed
- **Web UI styles missing in the published-package build** — `brv webui` from the installed CLI used to render shared components (dialogs, sheets) unstyled because the Tailwind `@source` glob didn't match the installed layout of `@campfirein/byterover-packages`.

## [3.8.0]

### Added
- **`brv webui` — a browser dashboard for ByteRover** — Run `brv webui` to open a local dashboard at `http://localhost:7700`. Browse and edit your context tree, review and commit changes, run curate and query, manage LLM providers and connected agents, and switch between projects — all from the browser. Still loads when the daemon isn't running, with a clear recovery screen. Use `--port <n>` to pick a different port (remembered across runs).
- **Guided first-run tour** — The web UI walks new users through setting up a provider, running their first curate and query, and connecting an agent. "Restart the tour" lives in the Help menu if you skip it.

### Changed
- **Connected agents now wait for `brv curate` by default** — The agent skill installed by `brv connectors install` tells Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, and other connected agents to let `brv curate` finish before moving on, so follow-up queries see the new data. Agents only fire-and-forget (`--detach`) when you explicitly say so. Re-run `brv connectors install <agent>` to update.
- **Updated default models** — OpenAI via OAuth now defaults to `gpt-5.4-mini`; MiniMax now defaults to `MiniMax-M2.7`.
- **Complete frontmatter on context files** — Context-tree markdown files written by `brv curate` and `brv dream` now always include all seven semantic fields (title, summary, tags, related, keywords, createdAt, updatedAt). Older files without them still load fine.

### Fixed
- **ByteRover OAuth login now resumes provider setup** — Picking ByteRover while signed out used to bounce you back to the provider list after login; it now continues the setup automatically.
- **No more "Connecting to ByteRover…" hang after a fresh login** — Provider connect sees new credentials immediately instead of waiting up to 5 seconds for a cache refresh.
- **Security dependency update** — Patched `@hono/node-server` and `hono` to address a high-severity npm advisory.

## [3.7.1]

### Changed
- **Agent skill template — dedicated "Query and Curate History" section** — The bundled `SKILL.md` installed via `brv connectors install` (for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, and other skill-based agents) now has a dedicated Section 11 covering `brv curate view`, `brv query-log view`, and `brv query-log summary` — including the resolution-tier taxonomy (0=exact cache … 4=full agentic) and time/status filters. Connected agents will now reach for history and recall metrics when debugging knowledge gaps instead of guessing. Re-run `brv connectors install <agent>` to regenerate the skill for an existing connector.

### Fixed
- **`brv vc status` stays clean after queries and curates** — Runtime ranking signals (hotness, recency, access counts, maturity) used to live in markdown frontmatter, so every `brv search`, `brv query`, or agent curate silently dirtied context files and polluted `brv vc status` / `brv vc diff`. Those signals now live in a per-project sidecar outside the context tree; markdown keeps only semantic fields (title, tags, keywords, summary, related, createdAt, updatedAt). Older context trees with legacy signal fields in frontmatter continue to parse — stale fields are ignored on read, so no migration is needed.
- **Synthesis files no longer leak `maturity: draft` into frontmatter** — `brv dream synthesize` previously wrote `maturity: draft` into the YAML frontmatter of each new synthesis file; that field now seeds the sidecar instead, leaving the synthesis markdown body and frontmatter free of ranking state.
- **`brv vc` diffs no longer show OS / editor noise** — Added the following patterns to the context-tree `.gitignore` so they're excluded from `brv vc` tracking: `.DS_Store`, `._*` (macOS); `Thumbs.db`, `ehthumbs.db`, `Desktop.ini` (Windows); `.directory`, `.fuse_hidden*`, `.nfs*` (Linux); and editor swap/backup/temp patterns `*.swp`, `*.swo`, `*~`, `.#*`, `*.bak`, `*.tmp`. Patterns auto-sync into existing projects on the next `brv vc` command — no manual `.gitignore` edit required.

## [3.7.0]

### Added
- **Intel Mac (darwin-x64) install support** — `curl -fsSL https://byterover.dev/install.sh | sh` now installs on Intel Macs. Previously the installer rejected `darwin-x64` with an Apple-Silicon-only error. CI also publishes a `darwin-x64` tarball alongside the existing `darwin-arm64`, `linux-x64`, and `linux-arm64` builds.

### Fixed
- **Security dependency update** — Updated `basic-ftp` and `hono` to patch a high-severity npm advisory.

## [3.6.0]

### Added
- **`brv dream` — tidy up your context tree** — A new command that cleans up your memory in the background: merges related notes, writes short summaries that connect ideas across topics, and archives stale entries. It runs on its own when the CLI has been idle for a while, or you can run it yourself. Changes the model is unsure about are held for you to review with `brv review pending`, and `brv dream --undo` reverts the last run. Flags: `--force` / `-f` to skip the time and activity gates, `--detach` to queue and exit without waiting, `--undo`, `--timeout <seconds>`, `--format json`.
- **`brv query-log` — see what you've asked before** — Every `brv query` is now saved locally so you can look back at past questions and how they were answered. `brv query-log view` lists recent queries with filters `--status`, `--tier`, `--since`, `--before`, and `--limit`, plus `--detail` to also show the matched docs for each entry, and `--format json`. `brv query-log summary` shows aggregated metrics — coverage, cache hit rate, and top topics — over a window set by `--last`, `--since`, or `--before`, with `--format` options `text`, `json`, or `narrative` for a plain-English recap.

## [3.5.1]

### Changed
- **Clearer MCP tool descriptions** — The `cwd` parameter on `brv-curate` and `brv-query` MCP tools now tells the calling LLM exactly when the project path is required (Claude Desktop, hosted MCP) vs. optional (Cursor, Cline, Zed, Claude Code). This reduces failed tool calls from clients that omitted the path or guessed a relative one.

## [3.5.0]

### Added
- **Claude Desktop support** — Connect ByteRover to the Claude Desktop app with `brv connectors install "Claude Desktop"` (or pick it in `/connectors`). Works on macOS, Windows (including Store installs), and Linux. After installing, fully quit Claude Desktop from the tray or menu bar and reopen it to apply.

### Changed
- **Cleaner install layout** — The `install.sh` installer now keeps its bundled Node.js tucked away so it won't conflict with the `node` already on your system. Just reinstall to pick up the new layout.

### Fixed
- **Security dependency update** — Updated `basic-ftp` to patch a high-severity vulnerability.

## [3.4.0]

### Added
- **`brv swarm` — unified memory swarm** — Connect multiple memory providers (ByteRover context tree, Obsidian vaults, local markdown folders, GBrain, OpenClaw Memory Wiki) into a single query and storage layer. `brv swarm onboard` walks through an interactive setup wizard; `brv swarm status` shows provider health, write targets, and enrichment topology. `brv swarm query <question>` runs intelligent routing, parallel provider execution, and Reciprocal Rank Fusion merging — add `--explain` for classification reasoning and provider selection details. `brv swarm curate <content>` stores to the best writable provider based on content classification (`--provider` to override), falling back to ByteRover context-tree curation when no external target is available. Control how providers feed context to each other via `enrichment.edges` in `swarm.config.yaml` — the engine validates cycles, self-edges, and missing providers, and disabled-provider edges produce warnings instead of errors so partial setups degrade gracefully. The agent also gains `swarm_query` and `swarm_store` tools, and sandboxed code can call `tools.swarmQuery()` / `tools.swarmStore()`.
- **GPT-5.4 Mini support** — Added `gpt-5.4-mini` to the Codex allowed models list.

### Fixed
- **Context-tree `.gitignore` auto-sync** — The context-tree `.gitignore` now stays up to date automatically. When any `brv vc` command runs, missing patterns are appended to the existing file instead of only being written on first init. This prevents derived artifacts from polluting `brv vc` diffs after CLI updates.
- **Stale knowledge locations** — Knowledge entries whose source files were deleted are now cleaned up, preventing dead references in search and query results.
- **Security dependency update** — Pinned axios to 1.15.0 to address a critical vulnerability.

## [3.3.0]

### Added
- **`brv search` — BM25 context tree search** — New command for pure BM25 retrieval over the context tree (no LLM, no provider, no token cost). Returns ranked paths, scores, and excerpts. Flags: `--limit` (1–50), `--scope <prefix>`, `--format json`. Use `brv search` for structured results and `brv query` for synthesized answers.
- **`--timeout` flag for `brv curate` and `brv query`** — Override the previous hardcoded 5-minute limit so slow local models can finish. Accepts seconds (default 300, max 3600); no effect with `--detach`.

### Fixed
- **Misleading "no space configured" error on `brv push` / `brv pull`** — Legacy sync now shows a clear deprecation message pointing at `brv vc init` instead of the deprecated `brv space switch` flow. TUI also links to the [version control docs](https://docs.byterover.dev/git-semantic/overview).
- **`brv status` auto-created `.snapshot.json` without team/space config** — VC-managed projects no longer get a stray legacy-sync snapshot file; status now reports `Managed by Byterover version control` instead.
- **Adaptive `*.abstract.md` / `*.overview.md` files polluting `brv vc` diffs** — These derived artifacts are now in the context-tree `.gitignore` and excluded from version control.

## [3.2.0]

### Added
- **`brv worktree` — git-style worktree links** — Register a subdirectory (or sibling) as a worktree of a parent project without creating a nested `.brv/`. `brv worktree add [path]` writes a `.brv` pointer file in the target that redirects to the parent — the same pattern as `git worktree` (path defaults to the current directory for auto-detect from a subdirectory). `brv worktree list` shows the current link state and registered worktrees; `brv worktree remove [path]` unregisters (also defaults to cwd). `--force` lets `add` convert an existing `.brv/` directory into a pointer by backing it up to `.brv-backup/`; `remove` restores that backup automatically if present. Also available as `/worktree` in the REPL.
- **`brv source` — cross-project knowledge sources** — Link another project's context tree as a read-only knowledge source. `brv source add <path> [--alias <name>]` attaches a source; `brv source list` shows linked sources with validity; `brv source remove <alias-or-path>` detaches. Linked sources are write-protected, and query results pulled from them are tagged with a `shared` origin and their alias so you can tell which project an answer came from. Also available as `/source` in the REPL.
- **Resolver-aware `brv status`** — `brv status` now surfaces the resolved project root, the linked worktree root (when different), knowledge-source validity, and actionable warnings for broken or malformed worktree pointers and sources. `--verbose` adds the resolution source (`direct` / `linked` / `flag`). A new `--project-root <path>` flag on `brv status` overrides auto-detection and fails loudly when the path is not a ByteRover project instead of silently falling back to the current directory.

### Changed
- **Workspace-aware curate and query** — `brv curate` and `brv query` now automatically detect when you're inside a linked worktree and pass the worktree root to the daemon alongside the project root. Explicit relative paths you pass yourself (e.g. `brv curate -f ./src/auth.ts`, `brv curate -d ./packages/api/src`) still resolve from your shell cwd to match normal shell behavior.

## [3.1.0]

### Added
- **Adaptive knowledge scoring** — The knowledge base now prioritizes content based on usage patterns. Frequently accessed knowledge ranks higher in search results through hotness scoring and hierarchical score propagation.
- **Knowledge abstracts** — Knowledge entries automatically generate compressed summaries (abstracts and overviews), reducing token usage while preserving key information for the agent.
- **Session learning** — The agent extracts patterns, preferences, decisions, and skills from your sessions and stores them as durable knowledge, improving responses over time.
- **Resource ingestion tool** — The agent can now ingest external files and resources directly into your knowledge base.

### Fixed
- **Stale CLI cache after upgrades** — Install and uninstall scripts now clean the oclif client cache, preventing issues caused by cached data from previous versions.
- **Knowledge search accuracy** — Fixed double compound scoring in parent propagation, improved maturity filtering, and corrected result truncation for more relevant search results.

## [3.0.0]

### Added
- **`brv vc` — Git version control commands** — A full suite of Git-like commands (`init`, `clone`, `status`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `branch`, `checkout`, `merge`, `reset`, `remote`, `log`, `fetch`) that sync context alongside code through ByteRover's remote.
- **Human-in-the-loop review system** — Review pending curate operations before they are applied. Use `brv review pending` to list, `brv review approve` to accept, and `brv review reject` to discard.

### Changed
- **Legacy commands show `brv vc` hints** — Running `brv status`, `brv pull`, or `brv push` now displays a tip about the corresponding `brv vc` command.
- **Name-based remote URLs** — Remote URLs now use human-readable names.
- **Team and space persisted on remote add** — `brv vc remote add` and `brv vc remote set-url` now persist team and space identifiers to `config.json`.
- **(Deprecated) `brv space list` and `brv space switch`** — These commands still work but show a deprecation notice directing users to the web dashboard.

### Fixed
- **Provider error messages** — CLI text-mode commands now show the actual backend error message instead of a misleading "API key is missing or invalid" fallback.
- **Security dependency updates** — Patched `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `@xmldom/xmldom`, `lodash`, and `lodash-es` to address known vulnerabilities.

## [2.6.0]

### Changed
- Refactor and major code cleanup.

## [2.5.2]

### Fixed
- **Pinned axios to exact version 1.14.0** — Locked the axios dependency to an exact known-good version to mitigate supply-chain security risks. Previously used a caret range (`^1.12.2`) that could pull in untrusted future releases.

## [2.5.1]

### Fixed
- **Provider connect/switch showed false success on auth errors** — `brv providers connect` and `brv providers switch` now correctly detect when the server rejects the request and display the actual error message (e.g., authentication required) instead of falsely reporting success.

## [2.5.0]

### Added
- **Inline login for ByteRover provider** — When selecting or activating ByteRover without being logged in, the CLI now shows an inline login prompt instead of failing. Users authenticate through the browser without leaving the provider setup flow. Tasks also validate authentication before execution and show a clear message if login is needed.

### Fixed
- **Proxy double-routing on corporate networks** — Fixed an issue where HTTP requests could be routed through a proxy twice when `HTTPS_PROXY` was set, causing connection failures. Axios's built-in proxy is now explicitly disabled in favor of the custom `proxy-agent` already in use.
- **Security dependency updates** — Patched npm dependencies to address high-severity vulnerabilities.

## [2.4.1]

### Fixed
- **Agent startup reliability improved** — Increased the timeout for agent child processes to become ready from 15 to 30 seconds, reducing timeout failures on slower machines or under heavy load.
- **Console window flash on Windows** — Agent child processes no longer briefly flash a console window when spawned on Windows.
- **Security dependency updates** — Patched npm dependencies to address high-severity vulnerabilities.

## [2.4.0]

### Added
- **Enterprise proxy support** — All HTTP traffic now automatically routes through corporate proxies when standard environment variables are set (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`). For environments with SSL inspection, set `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` to your corporate CA certificate. The CLI provides clear error messages when proxy or certificate issues are detected.

## [2.3.4]

### Changed
- **ByteRover provider request format simplified** — Reduced unnecessary fields sent to the server for cleaner request handling.

## [2.3.3]

### Fixed
- **Streaming errors from OAuth providers showed `[object Object]`** — Error messages from LLM provider streaming failures (e.g. OpenAI via OAuth) now display the actual error detail instead of an unhelpful `[object Object]` string.

## [2.3.2]

### Removed
- **`better-sqlite3` dependency** — Removed the unused native SQLite package that was left over after the migration to file-based storage in 2.1.0. This reduces install size and eliminates native compilation requirements on some platforms.

## [2.3.1]

### Fixed
- **OpenRouter provider name format** — OpenRouter models now display as `OpenRouter (<provider>)` instead of a capitalized provider name, making it easier to identify when using an OpenRouter-routed model.
- **`brv update` blocked for npm installations** — Running `brv update` when installed via npm now shows a clear error directing users to run `npm update -g byterover-cli` instead. Previously produced confusing errors.
- **`brv restart` no longer kills itself or triggers daemon respawn** — Rewrote restart with a 4-phase shutdown sequence (kill clients, graceful daemon stop, clean orphans, clean state files).
- **Security dependency updates** — Patched `socket.io` and `@campfirein/brv-transport-client` to address high-severity vulnerabilities.

## [2.3.0]

### Added

- **OAuth provider authentication** — Connect to LLM providers by signing in via your browser instead of manually entering API keys. OpenAI is the first supported OAuth provider. Run `/providers` in the REPL or `brv providers connect openai --oauth` from the command line to authenticate through the browser. Tokens are securely stored and automatically refreshed by the daemon.

### Changed

- **Provider list shows authentication method** — `brv providers list` now displays `[OAuth]` or `[API Key]` badges next to connected providers indicating how they were authenticated.
- **Reconnect option for OAuth providers** — Already-connected OAuth providers show a "Reconnect OAuth" option in `/providers` to re-authenticate or switch accounts.

## [2.2.0]

### Added

- **`brv locations` command** — List all registered projects and their context tree status. Shows which projects are initialized, which is current, and which have active connections. Supports `--format json` for automation. Also available as `/locations` in the REPL.

## [2.1.5]

### Added

- **`brv logout` command** — Disconnect from ByteRover cloud and clear stored credentials from the CLI. Supports `--format json` for headless/automation use cases.

### Fixed

- **Security dependency updates** — Patched `flatted`, `hono`, and `yauzl` to address security vulnerabilities.

## [2.1.4]

### Fixed

- **Local Ollama and OpenAI-compatible providers work without an API key** — Providers that do not require an API key (e.g. local Ollama) no longer trigger a "provider key missing" error. Only providers that actually require a key are flagged when one is absent.

## [2.1.3]

### Fixed

- **`brv restart` killing itself and hanging terminal** — Fixed an issue where `brv restart` could kill its own parent shell wrapper process (used by native binary installations via `install.sh`), causing garbled terminal output and hangs. The restart command now also force-exits after completion to prevent stale oclif plugin handles from blocking the process.

## [2.1.2]

### Changed

- **Default LLM model switched to Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite** — The default model for the ByteRover provider is now `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`, replacing `gemini-3-flash-preview`, for improved performance and cost efficiency.

## [2.1.1]

### Changed

- **Skip update notifier for non-npm installations** - Update notifications are now suppressed when the CLI is not installed via `npm install -g`, preventing irrelevant update prompts for tarball and native binary users.
- **Auto-update frequency for native installations** - Configured oclif autoupdate with 1-day debounce for more reliable update checks on non-npm installations.

### Fixed

- **Security dependency updates** - Patched `fast-xml-parser`, `@aws-sdk/xml-builder`, and `@hono/node-server` to address security vulnerabilities.

## [2.1.0]

### Added

- **Agentic map system** - A new LLM-powered context map organizes knowledge hierarchically and enables smarter retrieval. Includes escalated compression strategies that adapt when context grows large, keeping responses accurate even for very large codebases.
- **`/exit` command** - Type `/exit` in the REPL to gracefully close the session (alternative to Ctrl+C).

### Changed

- **File-based storage** - Internal storage migrated from SQLite to plain files. Eliminates the native SQLite dependency for a simpler, more portable installation.

### Removed

- **Google Vertex AI provider** - The Vertex AI integration has been removed. Users relying on Google models should use Gemini via Gemini_API_key.

## [2.0.0]

### Added

- **Local-first mode** - CLI works without cloud authentication. A `.brv` directory is auto-created in the project root, and `/curate` and `/query` work fully offline.
- **Native binary installer** - Install on macOS and Linux without Node.js via `curl -fsSL https://byterover.dev/install.sh | sh`. Uninstaller script also available.
- **Multi-provider LLM support** - Connect to 20+ LLM providers via `/providers connect`: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Groq, Mistral, Perplexity, Cerebras, xAI, Together AI, and more.
- **OpenAI-compatible provider** - Use `--base-url` to connect custom endpoints such as Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM, and LocalAI.
- **Google Vertex AI support** - Service account credential support via `-f` flag in `brv providers connect`.
- **Hub registry** - Browse, install, and manage skills and bundles from registries. Add custom registries with auth support via `brv hub registry add`.
- **Knowledge scoring** - Compound scoring system (BM25 + importance + recency) with maturity tiers (draft, validated, core). Frequently used knowledge rises; neglected knowledge decays.
- **YAML frontmatter for context files** - Context files now use structured YAML frontmatter (title, tags, related, keywords) instead of `## Relations` sections.
- **New agent connectors** - Added OpenClaw, OpenCode, and Auggie CLI integrations, bringing total supported agents to 22.
- **Consolidated skill connector** - Single `SKILL.md` file for agent skill integration replaces multi-file approach.
- **Daemon architecture** - A global background daemon enables fast CLI startup and shared connections. Use `brv restart` to restart the daemon.
- **Parallel task execution** - Concurrent curate and query operations (up to 5 tasks) via per-task child sessions.
- **API key login** - Authenticate with `brv login -k <key>` for non-interactive or headless environments.
- **Knowledge attribution** - Query responses include a footer showing which context tree sources contributed to the answer.
- **Linux ARM64 support** - Native binary builds now available for Linux aarch64.
- **Context tree merge improvements** - Backup and conflict directories created during sync. Auto-pull on space switch with local change preservation.
- **Fact extraction** - Automatic facts extraction from content during curation.

### Changed

- **(Breaking) Provider command renamed** - `/provider` is now `/providers` for both the TUI slash command and the oclif command.
- **(Breaking) Model switch command renamed** - `model set` is now `model switch`.
- **(Breaking) Default provider changed** - The default LLM provider is now ByteRover instead of OpenRouter.
- **(Breaking) Provider config cleared on upgrade** - Existing provider configurations are cleared; re-setup is required after upgrading.
- **Provider management restructured** - Provider commands are now `brv providers list/connect/disconnect/switch` subcommands.
- **Model management restructured** - Model commands are now `brv model list/switch` subcommands.
- **Context-window-aware token management** - Compaction and truncation thresholds now adapt to the active model's context window size.
- **Config structure simplified** - Cloud fields (spaceId, teamId, etc.) are now optional, supporting local-first usage.
- **Documentation moved** - Detailed docs moved to docs.byterover.dev; README simplified.

### Fixed

- **Agent pool race condition** - Fixed concurrent agent session management causing intermittent failures.
- **Cross-project context writes** - Agent process working directory now correctly scoped to prevent writing context to wrong project.
- **Hub list timeouts** - Fixed first-run timeout when loading hub registry.
- **Rate limit handling** - Provider-aware retry delays prevent excessive retries on rate-limited requests.
- **Input paste corruption** - Replaced ink-text-input with direct input handling to fix paste-related text corruption.
- **Stale data in TUI commands** - Disabled React Query cache for TUI commands to ensure fresh data.
